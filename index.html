    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p>
        I served in the United States Army for six years, where I studied Arabic as a Human Intelligence Collector.
        I have earned my Associate degree from Wake Technical Community College, then transferred to Shaw University.
        I finished my studies as a Computer Science major at Shaw University to earned my Bachelor of Science degree.
        I have a solid background in Python 3, HTML5, CSS, and Java programming.

          I like to spend time creating things with my hands. I worked approximately 36 total hours on the bookshelf
          above. It is the largest project and piece that I have created.

      <h3 class="left-align">3D Printing</h3>
      <p>
          I have been 3D printing different pieces and objects since Christmas 2021. I have printed different objects
          that I have designed as well as pieces that others have designed and posted online. I designed and posted a
          version of a hexagonal medal holder for the different in-person and virtual races that I have competed in.
